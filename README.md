# Big Mart Sales Prediction using Machine Learning with Python

## Overview
This project aims to predict the sales of Big Mart outlets using machine learning techniques. Specifically, we utilize the XGBoost Regressor algorithm to forecast sales based on various features such as item weight, outlet size, outlet location, and other relevant factors.

## Project Structure
- **data**: Contains the datasets used in the project.
- **notebook**: Jupyter notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
